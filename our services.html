        <div>
           <p style="font-weight: 100; font-size: x-large;">Iridology is a powerful, non-invasive method used to gain insights into a person’s overall health by examining the patterns, colors, and structures of the iris—the colored part of the eye. At our wellness center, we offer professional Iridology Diagnostics to help individuals understand their body’s internal state and take proactive steps toward better health.Unlike conventional diagnostics that often focus solely on symptoms, Iridology looks deeper—analyzing the iris to identify potential areas of inflammation, toxicity, or stress in various organs and systems of the body. Every organ in the body is connected to the eye through the nervous system, making the iris a detailed map of one’s internal health. Through careful observation and analysis, our certified iridologists interpret signs that may point to inherited conditions, nutritional deficiencies, and early signs of imbalance—often before symptoms appear.</p>
