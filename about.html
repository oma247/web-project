  <h3>Why Alternative Medicine ?</h3>
  <p>Alternative Medicine or comparative medicine are practice of plant medicine that are documented and proven. Just like orthodox medicine, it is scientifically proven and documented . It is the use of plants and non plants to cure ailments. Alternative medicine encompasses a variety of healing practices outside of conventional Western medicine, often emphasizing a holistic approach to health and well-being. Its importance lies in its potential to address health concerns in ways that conventional medicine might not, including offering reduced side effects, personalized care, and a sense of empowerment. It can also be more accessible, affordable, and culturally relevant for some individuals. Alternative medicine is mainly about shifting the focus from orthodox medicine and embracing the healing power of nature. </p>
